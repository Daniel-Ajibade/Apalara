          <h2>How Did We Start…</h2>
          <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem">
            My love for the Yoruba language began in childhood when I lived with
            my grandmother in a village where
            <strong>
              Yoruba was the only language spoken. Moving from a sophisticated
              background into a purely traditional setting shaped my identity
              and exposed me deeply to **Yoruba proverbs, culture, values, and
              expressions. That environment made the language feel natural — not
              just as communication, but as **a way of life.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
            As I grew, that passion reflected in my academics. I was awarded
            <b>Best Student in Yoruba</b> during college, which encouraged me to
            pursue the language professionally. I went on to earn
            <b
              >two degrees in Yoruba Linguistics, graduating as the best student
              in my department.
