        My love for the Yoruba language began in childhood when I lived with my
        grandmother in a village where
        <b
          >Yoruba was the only language spoken. Moving from a sophisticated
          background into a purely traditional setting shaped my identity and
          exposed me deeply to Yoruba proverbs, culture, values, and
          expressions. That environment made the language feel natural not just
          as communication, but as a way of life.</b

      <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem">
        As I grew, that passion reflected in my academics. I was awarded
        <b>Best Student in Yoruba</b> during college, which encouraged me to
        pursue the language professionally. I went on to earn *two degrees in
        Yoruba Linguistics, graduating as
        <b>the best student in my department.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem">
        With over <b>five years of teaching experience</b> (online and onsite),
        I founded <b>Apalara Yoruba Language School Online</b>, where children

        confidence and cultural pride.

        Today, my mission is clear: To protect Yoruba language, promote
